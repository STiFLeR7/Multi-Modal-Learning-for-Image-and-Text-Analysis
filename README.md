### Project Overview
This repository explores the intersection of image and text analysis using multi-modal learning techniques. Our goal is to provide a robust framework for researchers and developers to build upon.

### Setup & Usage
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- Transformers Library

#### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/STiFLeR7/Multi-Modal-Learning-for-Image-and-Text-Analysis.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run a sample analysis: `python run_analysis.py -i <image_path> -t <text_input>`

### Example Use Cases
[**Image: Example Output for Image-Text Analysis**]
- **Sentiment Analysis with Visual Context**: Enhance sentiment analysis of text by considering the context provided by images.
- **Automated Content Moderation**: Improve accuracy in content moderation by analyzing both textual and visual elements.
