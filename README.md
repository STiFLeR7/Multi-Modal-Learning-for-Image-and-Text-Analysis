## Setup and Usage

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/STiFLeR7/Multi-Modal-Learning-for-Image-and-Text-Analysis.git

    cd Multi-Modal-Learning-for-Image-and-Text-Analysis


 2. **Install required dependencies**
 
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Train and Evaluate**
```bash
python train.py

python evaluate.py
```
## Example Use Cases
This framework supports various applications, including:

Image-Text Matching: Aligning images with corresponding textual descriptions.
Visual Question Answering (VQA): Answering questions based on visual content.
Image Captioning: Generating textual descriptions for images.
Sentiment Analysis with Visual Context: Analyzing sentiment in text with accompanying images.
For detailed examples and implementation specifics, refer to the
```bash model_architecture.py and dataset.py .```
